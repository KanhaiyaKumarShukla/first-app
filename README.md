# first-app
In this app, i have only used, a text view and set it as the main content in the activity.
* AppCompatActivity class is a base class for activities in Android.
* onCreate method is called when the activity is created. It is a method of superclass AppCompatActivity.
* I have created a instance og TextView.And set the text and size and maximum line.
* And set the view in activity.
Here, in this app, we can delete its layout file, still it will print the desired output.
